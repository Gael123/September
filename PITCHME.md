##  Code Of Conduct
######  **`ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`**
######  **`ruby.org.au/committee-members`**
######  **`conduct@ruby.org.au`**

Note:
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

Note:
Ruby Australia, who organise sponsorship of all Ruby-related meet-ups around Australia make the delicious non-pizza dinner possible.<br />
That food budget is covered by Ruby Australia, and hence their sponsors are our sponsors, so we would like to thank...
